# Azure DevOps Dashboard
This dashboard gives an overview of the performance of build and release pipelines by using the WebAPI tile to query https://analytics.dev.azure.com to get the data.

- Build – a simple summary of the number of failed builds in the last 14 days.
- Build Duration – average time for build completion.
- Build Failures – number of failures in any release pipeline per day. 
- Build Failure By Stage Name – a count of fails per release stage. 
- Job Queue – count of the number of requests per day that end up in a queue. 
- MS Agent Usage – number of MS hosted agents that are in use.
- E2ETesting Failures – three tiles showing the count of fails for specific automation tests in that release pipeline stage.
- Average E2E Testing Time – three tiles returning the average run time for automation stages.
